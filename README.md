# Voice Activated Inventory Assistant
This is a smart inventory assistant that integrates your data with an AI model using Model Context Protocol(MCP). 

# Description
It uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) to link GPT-style language understanding with structured inventory data and a predictive model. All voice input is processed offline, and the assistant can take actions based on your spoken prompts.

Overview about this Project?
To build an offline, voice-enabled analytics tool

To explore GPT4All + inventory Data + predictive modeling integration

To create a smart agent that‚Äôs usable in real retail scenarios

Future Improvements
